										<h3>About Me</h3>
										<a href="images/thumbs/websiteProfile.png"><img src="images/thumbs/websiteProfile.png" alt="" title="This is Me, Nathnael." width="205" height="195"></a>
										<p>I am studying Computer Science at the University of Minnesota’s College of Science and Engineering. I was born and grew up in Eritrea, a small country in East Africa. In the summer of 2016, I moved to the United States. This big change took me from a place I knew well to a new country full of opportunities, especially in technology. Back in Eritrea, I started to get interested in how technology can solve problems. Now, at the University of Minnesota, I’m learning a lot about computer science. My goal is to use what I learn to make a positive difference. I bring with me the hard work, creativity, and sense of community from my home country as I explore new ideas in the United States.</p>
										<h3>My vision</h3>
										<p>My vision involves collaborating with individuals who need assistance in leveraging their expertise through technology. I aim to support those lacking the opportunities I’ve been afforded, making myself available to share my knowledge with them. I’m passionate about demonstrating the transformative power of technology, believing that by addressing each expert’s challenges one at a time, we can incrementally improve the lives of many.</p>
